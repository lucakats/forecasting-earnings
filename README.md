# forecasting-earnings

In this repository you will find my first of 2 SAS projects completed through post-grad study (individual tasks). The assignment asked we used our newly acquired knowledge of SAS create models to predict future earnings. We first prepared the data, then performed some basic statistics to better understand it, where finally we created models and backtested these models to determine accuracy.

This repo includes the final PDF, as well as a .Txt file with the corresponding SAS code used to feed the report's findings.

SAS code was written in SAS Studio (SAS OnDemand for Academics - included in post-grad study)
